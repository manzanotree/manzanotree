A program to automate email spam to select targets. 
To be used where the user has little recourse against a 
larger and more powerful group who ignores any communication. 
This was created specifically when a landlord ignored my 
requests regarding a security deposit for weeks. It eventually worked.

Built with:
* Express
* Nodemailer

Features:
* Bulk send a configurable amount of emails to multiple recipients in one fell swoop.
* Bulk send a configurable amount of emails to multiple recipients every day. Every hour. Even every minute. 
There's no limit to this war chest.
* If you're familiar with the Fibonacci sequence, then this is a fun one. 
Send Fib-n emails to multiple recipients every day, where n is the index in the sequence, for up to 10 days. 
This is capped at 10 days due to memory constraints.
